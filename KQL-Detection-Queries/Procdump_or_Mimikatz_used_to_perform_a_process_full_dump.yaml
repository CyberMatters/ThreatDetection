Detection rule: Procdump_or_Mimikatz_used_to_perform_a_process_full_dump

Description: |
    This rule will trigger an alert when ProcDump or mimikatz is used to perfrom a full dump on a process (an attacker would dump lsass.exe).
    This can be used by attacker to dump lsass.exe for instance and extract useful information like credentials.
    Action to perform:
    - analyze process lineage
    - origin of procdump.exe/mimikatz on the device
